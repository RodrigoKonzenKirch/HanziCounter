Input Japanese or Chinese text and see which characters(漢字/汉字) are more or less common. This app is useful for people who study Japanese or Chinese. The student can easily learn the most common characters that are shown at the top of the list or have a look at the least common characters at the bottom.

When a text is inputted, the app will show how many times each character appears in the text. The list of characters is shown ordered by the most common characters. Also, when a character is selected in the list, all occurrences of it are highlighted in the text above.

Example with Japanese text:

    Input: "日本の本です。"
    Output: [本 2], [日 1], [の 1], [で 1], [す 1]

Example with Chinese text:

    Input: "我是我，你是谁？我不知道我是谁！"
    Output: [我 4], [是 3], [谁 2], [你 1], [不 1], [知 1], [道 1]
